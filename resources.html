                <h2>Academics</h2>
                <p>For international students, adapting to a new education system and language while simultaneously adjusting to a new culture can be daunting. 
                    A good academic record can help students secure scholarships for their tetiary education, or enter certain selective pre-professional programmes. 
                    The good news is your academic experience can be much more stressless with some quality (and free!) resources.
